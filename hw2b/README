Homework 2 Part 2
Due: 10/22/2013
Students: Eric Kim

==== Answers to Questions ====

1. Yes, if you assume certain conditions.

2. Let's assume that the scene is planar. This is a reasonable
   assumption, since the terrain of the Mars at the image locations
   is reasonably flat.

3. Yes: at time of spirit1433.png (the last image of the sequence),
   I estimated that the velocity magnitude is ~73.81 m/s, which is
   less than the 80m/s rating.
   So, no need to fire the horizontal rockets.

==== Instructions ====

From the MATLAB interactive prompt, invoke the hw2b.m function. Your
output should look like:

    >>> hw2b();

    spirit1983->spirit1706: 75.117541 m/s

    Do not need to fire the horiz. rockets, our velocity 73.812044 is less than the limit 80m/s
   
==== Approach ====

At a high level: we wish to estimate the camera motion g=(R,T) from 
one image to the next. If we can estimate this g=(R,T) (say, from
spirit1983 to spirit1706), then T can tell us the displacement (in 
meters) between the two images: T_meters.

[For the following, let's focus on the two images spirit1983 and
spirit1706. The same approach can be applied to spirit1706, spirit1433.]

From T_meters, we can compute the velocity. For instance, from 
spirit1983 to spirit1706, the delt_time=3.75 s:
    velocity_vector = T_meters / 3.75s
    velocity = || velocity_vector ||_2    # the L2 norm

To estimate g=(R,T) from just the point correspondences between the
two images, let's assume the scene is planar. This is a reasonable
assumption, as the terrain of Mars in these images appear to be
reasonably flat. With this assumption, the geometry works out that we
can compute the relative motion of the cameras g=(R,T) given JUST the
homography H that maps pixel coordinates in spirit1983 to pixel 
coordinates in spirit1706. 

The algorithm that decomposes the homography H into a g=(R,T) is
the 'four-point algorithm' in the MaSKS textbook (Algorithm 5.2).

To convert the computed T into T_meters, we exploit the fact that we
know the Z displacement between spirit1983 and spirit1706: -277 meters:

    T_meters = T / (T(3) / -277)

Finally, the approach can be summarized as:

0. Calibrate the pixel coordinates A using the camera calibration matrix
   to get calibrated coordinates A'
1. Compute the point correspondences from img1 to img2 [HW2 Part 1]
2. Apply the "Four Point Algorithm" (Algorithm 5.2, MaSKS) to estimate
   the homography H, and the g=(R,T)
3. Compute the velocity.
