HW 4: Build a Lane-Departure Warning System

==== Instructions ====
======================

To run the lane departure warning system demo, run:

    $ python demo_full_pipeline.py

This script demos a simple lane-departure warning system on the test
images in:
    LDWS_test_short/

The script first determines the camera calibration parameters by
processing the planar calibration object in:
    LDWS_calibrate_short/

Then, each test image is processed, and after the lanes+extrinsic
parameters are estimated, the following output appears:
    1.) On stdout, the estimated camera position w.r.t. the middle
        of the lane (along with a warning if the camera position is
        too far away from the center).
    2.) Two image windows display. One with the detected lane positions,
        and another with a top-down ("birds-eye") view of the road,
        obtained by undo-ing the perspective distortion.
