Several photos of a calibration pattern taken with my camera. These
are intended to be used in conjunction with the planar images in:

    ../planar_koopa_med/

Note: I apologize, these calibration images are fairly poor quality,
but, opencv seems robust enough to be able to perform calibration
even on these.
