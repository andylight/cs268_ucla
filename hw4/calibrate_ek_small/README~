Several photos of a calibration pattern taken with my camera. These
are intended to be used in conjunction with the planar images in:

    ../planar_koopa_med/

These photos were taken during the same photo session as the above:
in particular, zoom/autofocus/etc. was disabled.

Note: I apologize, these calibration images are fairly poor quality,
but, opencv seems robust enough to be able to perform calibration
even on these.
